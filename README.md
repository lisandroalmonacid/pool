## Pool

Simple 8-ball pool Pool developed in C++, using the SDL2 library for rendering.

## Play
In a Windows PC, download and open `Pool.exe`.

## Compiling source
Libraries:

SDL2-2.26.2 i686-w64-mingw32
SDL2_image-2.6.3 i686-w64-mingw32
SDL2_ttf-2.20.2 i686-w64-mingw32

The Makefile assumes that they're installed in `C:\SDL\`. This can be easily modified if you have them installed in another directory. Other versions of the library can probably be used.
